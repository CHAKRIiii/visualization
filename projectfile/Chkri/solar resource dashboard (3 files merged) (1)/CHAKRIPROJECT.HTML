<h1>VISIBILITY BASED ON SKY COVER AND AVG WIND SPEED IN 2008 AND 2009</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031304350.jpg">
<p>The relationship between visibility and sky cover in the context of solar power generation is crucial because both factors affect the amount of sunlight that reaches solar panels and, consequently, the efficiency of solar energy production</p>
<h1>AVG WIND SPPED AND AVG PRESSURE IN 2008 AND 2009 AND POWER GENERATED BY RELATIVE HUMIDITY</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031304526.jpg">
<p>It is a measure of the amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount the air can hold at a specific temperature. Relative humidity is not a direct source of energy or power generation. Solar panels and wind turbines, on the other hand, are examples of technologies used to generate power from natural elements like sunlight and wind, but relative humidity itself does not produce power.</p>
<h1>SKY COVER BY VISIBILITY IN EVERY MONTH AND DISTENCE TO SOLAR NOON BY DAY LIGHT</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031304779.jpg">
<p>The "distance to solar noon" and daylight are related due to the movement of the sun in the sky throughout the day. Here's the connection:

<br>*Solar Noon: Solar noon is the point in the day when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. It typically occurs around 12:00 PM local solar time. This is when the sun is closest to being directly overhead.

<br>*Daylight Duration: The time from sunrise to sunset makes up the total daylight duration. As you approach solar noon, the sun's angle in the sky increases, and daylight duration is at its midpoint.

<br>*Distance to Solar Noon: The "distance to solar noon" measures the time remaining until solar noon. It is an indicator of how close or far you are from reaching the point of maximum sun angle for the day.

<br>*Impact on Solar Power: Solar panels are most efficient when they receive sunlight at a near-optimal angle, which occurs around solar noon. So, the "distance to solar noon" is crucial for solar power generation. The closer you are to solar noon, the more direct and intense the sunlight, which maximizes power production.

<br>*Energy Management: Understanding the distance to solar noon is essential for managing energy usage and optimizing the timing of energy-intensive activities during the day, as it relates to the availability of abundant sunlight.</p>

<h1>:::REPORT:::</h1>
<p>In data analytics, a "report" refers to a structured document or presentation that provides a comprehensive and detailed account of data analysis, findings, and insights. Reports are typically used to document and communicate the results of data analysis to a wider audience, often including stakeholders, management, or other interested parties. Here's a breakdown of the key elements of a data analytics report:</p>  
<h1>AVG WIND SPEED IN 2008 AND 2009 AND POWER GENERATED BY VISIBILITY</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031130578.jpg"> 
<P>For wind power, visibility impacts the efficiency of wind turbines. Poor visibility can be a result of obstructed airflow near the turbine blades, reducing wind speed and the potential for electricity generation. Similarly, air quality and pollutants can affect both solar panels and wind turbines, decreasing their performance due to the accumulation of contaminants.</P>
<h1>VISIBLITY AND SKY COVER IN 2008 AND 2009 RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND DISTENCE TO SOLAR NOON </h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031131032.jpg">
<p>Visibility and sky cover are closely related meteorological factors that influence how much of the sky and distant objects can be seen from a specific location. Sky cover refers to the extent to which the sky is obscured by clouds or other atmospheric conditions. Visibility, on the other hand, measures how clearly objects can be seen at a given distance.</p>
<h1>HUMIDITY AND POWER GENERATION IN 2008 AND 2009</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031131447.jpg">
<p>humidity indirectly impacts power generation, mainly in the case of solar and some thermal power plants. Understanding its effects on these systems is important for optimizing power production and assessing environmental conditions.</p>
<h1>SKY COVER AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY OF EVERY MONTH AND POWER GENERATION IN EVERY MONTH BASED ON VISIBILITY</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031132921.jpg">
<p>sky cover and relative humidity are intertwined factors in meteorology, impacting cloud formation, weather patterns, and sunlight availability. Their interaction has significant implications for various aspects of daily life and environmental assessments.</p>
<h1>AVG BAROMATRIC PRESSURE IN 2008 AND 2009</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031133194.jpg">
<p>Barometric pressure, also known as atmospheric pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of the Earth's atmosphere on a unit area. It is typically measured in millibars or inches of mercury. Barometric pressure is related to solar power generation in the following ways:

<br>*Weather Prediction: Changes in barometric pressure are indicative of weather patterns. A falling barometric pressure may signal incoming clouds or storms, which can reduce solar power output due to decreased sunlight.

<br>*Air Density: Barometric pressure affects air density. Lower pressure at higher altitudes can result in thinner air, which can impact the efficiency of solar panels as they rely on the density of air to transfer heat.

<br>*Temperature Changes: Barometric pressure is often linked to temperature changes. Solar panel efficiency is temperature-dependent, so variations in pressure can indirectly impact power generation through temperature fluctuations.

<br>*High-Pressure Systems: High-pressure systems are often associated with clear skies and sunny weather, promoting optimal conditions for solar power generation.

<br>*Low-Pressure Systems: Low-pressure systems are associated with cloudy or stormy weather, which can reduce solar power generation due to decreased sunlight.

<br>*Understanding barometric pressure can help solar power system operators anticipate weather changes and plan for potential fluctuations in power generation.</p>
<h1>EFFECTS OF WIND ON POWER GENERATION</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\sonty\OneDrive\Desktop\pictures\1697031133331.jpg">
<p>Wind speed affects solar power generation in the following ways:

<br>*Cooling: Moderate wind cools solar panels, improving their efficiency.
<br>*Dust and Debris: Wind can carry dust and debris, which may reduce efficiency by accumulating on panels.
<br>*Potential Damage: High winds, especially during storms, can damage solar panels and components.
<br>*Angle Adjustment: Wind can affect tracking systems that adjust panel angles for optimal sun exposure.
<br>*Turbulence: Wind turbulence can lead to mechanical stress and affect power output.
Proper design and maintenance are crucial for maximizing solar power generation while accounting for varying wind conditions.</p>
